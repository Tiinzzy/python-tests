Write an application that:

1- Gets an input string. Like "Montreal Weather" or "Inflation", "Market"...

2- Then uses "https://search.brave.com/news" to search for available news for the given input.

3- Then it extracts and stores 10 (or more) items of the results of the search  (probably just title or some summary, it is up to you)

4- And then uses some algorithm to say if the searched items in the file/ array is positive or negative "sentiment". (FIND OUT HOW TO DO THAT!)

5- Develop it in a way that works with a contex like "http://localhost:8089/news-sentiment"
	
What ever you don't understand or is ambiguous, make an assumption and go on. You should learn how to solve a problem ALONE. Use any language you like.

* add more sentiment processors
* process with all and send all to front-end as a whole result on how each are different or like each other
* https://spotintelligence.com/2022/12/16/sentiment-analysis-tools-in-python/
* how bag of words work? overall explanation
* fix the /news-sentiment to only work with that and not other /
* radio button to either get sentiment for each one of the titles one by one or total score as whole and say how many are positive and negative either single by single or as whole
