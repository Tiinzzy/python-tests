Write an application that:

1- Gets an input string. Like "Montreal Weather" or "Inflation", "Market"...

2- Then uses "https://search.brave.com/news" to search for avilable news for the given input.

3- Then it extracts and stores 10 (or more) items of the results of the search  (probably just title or some summary, it is up to you)

4- And then uses some algorithm to say if the searched items in the file/ array is positive or negative "sentiment". (FIND OUT HOW TO DO THAT!)

5- Develope it in a way that works with a contex like "http://localhost:8089/news-sentiment"
	
What ever you don't understand or is ambiguous, make an assumption and go on. You should learn how to solve a problem ALONE. Use any language you like.
